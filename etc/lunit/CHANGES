Release 0.5:

	New test function assert_error_match().
	Lunit shell script returns an error code on failed tests.
	Be more compatible with Darwin / Mac OS X.
	Bug fixes.

Release 0.4:

        Mostly complete rewrite.
        Lua-5.1 only.


Release 0.3 (alpha):

        New function lunit.wrap() to wrap a single function in a
        complete test case.

        Now a backtrace is printed, if an error or failure occurs
        in a test case.


Release 0.2 (alpha):

        The test suite consists now of approximately 630 assertions.

        Fixed an ugly bug in lunit.assert()! Testcases for lunit.assert()
        added.

        Now all assert functions return the actual value on success.
